# Gardening Tools

This directory is created for gathering all tools doing gardening in one place.
Every tool or script, big or small should go here, and over time, hopefully we
will have a useful collection of tools that support every part of the gardening
work.

The current (working) tools are:

- [compare_failures](#compare_failures)
- [status_summary](#status_summary)
- [current_summary](#current_summary)
- [luci](#luci)

All the tools have been created in an add-hoc manner, thus they solve specific
tasks that may not match your workflow fully. Feel free to add functionality to
these. Below is a detailed description of each of the tools.

## compare_failures ##
This tool compares a test log of a build step with previous builds. This is
particularly useful to detect changes over time, such as flakiness of failures,
timeouts or to find the build where a test started failing. The tool can be used
for a single builder (vertically) or a builder-group (horizontally and
vertically).

The tool displays the result of the latest 10 runs, which can be modified by the
option `--run-count=X` where `X` is the number of latest results to display.

Some typical use-cases are shown below.

#### Finding failing tests on one builder ####

Say a builder is going red, which means, for a step in that builder, some tests
have not met their expectation. One can then find stdout log of that step and
pass to the tool, as such:

Usage:

```console
dart bin/compare_failures.dart <stdio-url>
```

where `<stdio-url>` is a url for a test log ("https://.../logs/stdio") from the
buildbot. Here is an example:

```console
dart bin/compare_failures.dart https://uberchromegw.corp.google.com/i/client.dart/builders/vm-linux-release-x64-optcounter-threshold-be/builds/6786/steps/checked%20vm%20tests/logs/stdio

Errors for /builders/vm-linux-release-x64-optcounter-threshold-be/builds/6786/steps/checked vm tests :

 6777:             / -- OK --
 6776:             / -- OK --
```

#### Finding failing tests on a group of builders ####

Sometimes it may be that a group of builders started to turn red. To find if
there is any commonality between failing test, use the following command:

Usage:

```console
dart bin/compare_failures.dart <build-group>
```

where `<build-group>` is the name of the build-group as shown in the console.
Here is an example:

```console
dart bin/compare_failures.dart analyzer

```

## status_summary ##
Collects the configurations for all status files in the 'tests' folder that
mention one of the test names given as argument. This is useful to see what the
expectation of a particular test/group of tests have on different
configurations.

Usage:

```console
dart bin/status_summary.dart <test-name1> [<test-name2> ...]
```
where `<test-nameX>` are test names like `language/arithmetic_test` or `function_subtype_typearg2_test`.

#### Finding a summary for a specific test ####
Say that the test `function_subtype_typearg2_test` suddenly started to fail with
a `RuntimeError` on Safari in the dart2js safari builder group. It may be that
similar behavior was already spotted in the dart2js chrome builder group and had
been resolved (the status file was changed). One could then use run the
following command:

```console
dart bin/status_summary.dart function_subtype_typearg2_test

function_subtype_typearg2_test
  file:///usr/local/google/home/mkroghj/dart-sdk/sdk/tests/language/language_dart2js.status
    Crash        [ $compiler == dart2js && $dart2js_with_kernel && $host_checked ] NoSuchMethodError: The method 'hasSubclass' was called on null.
    Crash        [ $compiler == dart2js && $dart2js_with_kernel && $minified ]     NoSuchMethodError: The method 'hasSubclass' was called on null.
  file:///usr/local/google/home/mkroghj/dart-sdk/sdk/tests/language_strong/language_strong.status
    RuntimeError [ $compiler == dartdevc && $runtime != none ]                     Issue 29920
```
The output would then indicate if there are other expectations for the test
`function_subtype_typearg2_test` in other configurations.

## current_summary ##
Collects the test results for all build bots in [buildGroups] (defined in
lib/src/buildbot_data.dart) for tests that mention one of the test names given
as argument.

Usage:

```console
dart bin/current_summary.dart <test-name1> [<test-name2> ...]
```

where `<test-nameX>` are test names like `language/arithmetic_test`.

The results are currently pulled from the second to last build since the last
build might not have completed yet.

#### Finding if a test fails on other configurations ####

Say that a test `function_subtype_typearg2_test` is behaving strange and a few
builders have started to turn red, and you suspect this particular test for
being responsible. Running the following will provide an answer:

```console
dart bin/current_summary.dart function_subtype_typearg2_test

The above output has been truncated (shown as ...), to better indicate how the result of a test is shown. One can then grep for failing tests, as so:

```console
dart bin/current_summary.dart --group d8-minified language_2 | grep "fail:" -B 5 -A 5

  pass: dart2js-d8         dart2js-linux-d8-minified-1-5-be/dart2js-with-kernel-d8 tests

## luci ##

Luci is a tool made to query luci/logdog for information. The tool can be used
to find the information about build-bots, build groups, build-details and
commits across builds. There is nothing statically entered in the code files
regarding the bots, thus this tool has all current information.

Usage:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart <command>
```

To find help about each of the sub-tools, use `help` as `<command>`.

#### Find build-bots ####
The primary build-bots are those build-bots shown in the console view. To get
them as list:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --build-bots

ddc-win-release-stable
pkg-linux-release-dev
dart2js-mac10.11-safari-3-3-be
vm-mac-debug-x64-be
vm-win-debug-ia32-russian-stable
vm-win-debug-ia32-be
dart2js-linux-drt-1-2-stable
dart-sdk-linux-be
pkg-win7-release-stable
vm-kernel-mac-release-x64-be
dart2js-linux-d8-hostchecked-unittest-5-5-stable
...
```

Similarly, all build bots can be found by:
```console
dart bin/luci.dart --build-bots-all
```

#### Find build-groups ####

The build groups can be shown as such:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --build-groups

safari
vm
dart-sdk
vm-kernel
ddc
vm-product
analyzer
vm-misc
vm-reload
dart2js-jsshell
vm-app
pub-pkg
chrome
vm-precomp
dart2js-windows
dart2js-d8-minified
dart2js-linux
dart2js-d8-hostchecked
misc
```

This should match the view of the console.

#### Find builders in group ####

The tool can show all the builders in a specific group:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --builders-in-group <group>
```

where `<group>` is one of the groups shown above.

To find all the builders of the `chrome` builder group, use the following:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --builders-in-group chrome

dart2js-mac10.11-chrome-be
dart2js-linux-drt-1-2-be
dart2js-linux-drt-2-2-be
dart2js-linux-drt-csp-minified-be
```

#### Find detailed information about a build-bot ####

To find detailed information about a build on a build-bot, the following command
can be used. This essentially gives a view similar to the html-page that shows
information about a specific build, since it will give information about the
steps, files and commits.

Usage:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --build-details <builder> <number>
```

where `<builder>` is the name of the builder and `<number>` is the build number.
It can be used in the following way:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --build-details vm-linux-debug-x64-reload-be 2971
```

#### Builds with commit ####

The buildbot assigns a build number to each build on a builder.  To find the
build numbers corresponding to a specific commit, use the --builds-with-commit
option as follows:

Usage:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --builds-with-commit <commit_hash>
```

where `<commit_hash>` is the full hash of the specific commit. Since all bots
have to be checked, and one normally wants to investigate the latest commits,
the cache is only 15 minutes.

To run it, fx, on the hash `4d55a6779e6430c382bf0e0e4b8c0d61bee5c92c`, one can
run the following:

```console
dart bin/luci.dart --builds-with-commit 4d55a6779e6430c382bf0e0e4b8c0d61bee5c92c
2017-09-18 14:42:04.977786 Info: Sorry - this is going to take some time, since we have to look into all 25 latest builds for all bots for client client.dart.
Subsequent queries run faster if caching is not turned off...
The commit '4d55a6779e6430c382bf0e0e4b8c0d61bee5c92c is used in the following builds:

<!--
#### find_timeouts ####
Scans past `dart2js-windows` test steps for timeouts and reports the
frequency of each test that has timed out.

Usage:
```console
dart bin/find_timeouts.dart [<count>]
```

where `<count>` is the number past build that are scanned.   -->
